Elaborate descriptions to be added.

- state as a class with property setters
- property setters to maintain consistency
- single-surface, multiple-objects blitting on it is great
- tuples for action/item combinations of spritesheets
- use placeholder images that get replaced as assets get ready
- use utils file with mixin classes, e.g. for loading spritesheet
- maybe keep track of first frame of each effect for calculating things
- separate music vs sfx folder
- music is not scary
